# Blackjack

Bases:
* Considering a 416 cards deck that is mixed together after each game we will consider the chances of a card to pop up to be completely random;
* For now we will consider the as (card with number 1) to have a value of 11, even though it can be 1 depending on the occasion. I'll try to sort that later on;
* Since is a 2 players game, the dealer (DL) will always try to beat the player (PL).
